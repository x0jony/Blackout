# Blackout
Blackout is an EXILED plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory which disables all facility lights and provides every player with a flashlight or a lantern if they don't have one at the start of the round, based on a probability. The players have to activate all 3 generators to turn the lights back on.

## Features
- Starts at the start of the round based on a probability.
- Force the blackout to occur next round with a command:
  - `.blackout/.bl force/f` (Remote Admin)
- If the blackout occurs:
  - Disables all facility lights.
  - Provides all players with a flashlight if they don't have one.
  - Announces the blackout with a cool C.A.S.S.I.E message.
  - Disables all tesla gates.
- Ends the blackout if all 3 generators are engaged.

## Installation
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/x0jony/Blackout/releases/latest) of the plugin from the GitHub repository.
2. Place the `Blackout.dll` file in your `EXILED/Plugins` directory.
3. Restart your SCP: Secret Laboratory server.

## Configuration

## Credits
This plugin was originally [joker-119](https://github.com/joker-119)'s [idea](https://github.com/joker-119/SCPSL-Gamemodes), but since his version of the blackout had no builds and it was outdated, I decided to remake it with some different features.
